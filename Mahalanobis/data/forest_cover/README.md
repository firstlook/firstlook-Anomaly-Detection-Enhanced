Description:
The original ForestCover/Covertype dataset from UCI machine learning repository is a multiclass classification dataset. It is used in predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices
